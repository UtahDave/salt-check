Next items to do:
-----------------
- unit tests
- document how this software should be used, and how it works
- package for pip installs
- add more assertions
- support walking a file dir recursively to pick up all tests to run --> should keep tests results organized by file name for easy understanding of what happened.....e.g.  apache.tst versus mysql.tst --> outputs are given with a header of file they came from
- support ssh as a testing transport
- create example tests for others to use as templates (apache, php, mysql)


Assertions to support:
assertEqual
assertNotEqual
assertTrue
assertFalse
assertIsNone
assertIsNotNone
assertIn
assertNotIn
assertGreater
assertGreaterEqual
assertLess
assertLessEqual
assertItemsEqual
assertDictContainsSubset


Future features:
----------------
Create a dynamic test assembler based on what states are assembled for a minion in highstate compilation
Ability to save run output to a named file
Ability to test multiple tests via command line file
Add an optional timeout flag to increase timeout thresholds for set of tests
Consider running tests as groups for an increase in speed
Document and add example of how to limit tests to read-only actions
