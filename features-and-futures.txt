Next items to do:
-----------------
- unit tests for test loader
- create a sample state that will call salt_call with appropriate args - makes it easy to have checks run automatically after a state run
- create example states and tests for the following: 
  1.  apache (pkg, file, service)
  2.  mysql (pkg, file, service + global vars)

Future desired features (by priority):
----------------
Consider running tests as groups for an increase in speed - especially helpful for tests running over ssh
Create a dynamic test assembler based on what states are assembled for a minion in highstate compilation
Different output formats: text, json, yaml
Support test file formats: yaml, json


Possible future features:
----------------
Ability to test multiple tests via command line file
Add an optional timeout flag to increase timeout thresholds for set of tests
Document and add example of how to limit tests to read-only actions (same method as limited salt execution by user)
Add ability run tests locally (e.g. over salt-call)
Create testing modules which make the actual testing more concise from the viewpoint of yaml given (e.g. a test module that cross calls other modules already tested - should make it easy to see what did not match up)
