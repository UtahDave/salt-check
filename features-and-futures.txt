Next items to do:
-----------------
- unit tests for test file loader
- create a sample state that will call salt_call with appropriate args - makes it easy to have checks run automatically after a state run
- create example states and tests for the following: 
  1.  apache (pkg, file, service)
  2.  mysql (pkg, file, service + global vars)

Future desired features (by priority):
----------------
Consider running tests as groups for an increase in speed - especially helpful for tests running over ssh
Support test file formats: yaml and json


Possible future features:
----------------
Ability to test multiple tests via command line file
Add an optional timeout flag to increase timeout thresholds for set of tests
Document and add example of how to limit tests to read-only actions (same method as limited salt execution by user)
